# Event Booking System - Project Estimation

## Project Overview & Scope

### Core Requirements
- Frontend: TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn/ui components
- Backend: Sanity CMS, NextAuth, Redis
- Authentication: Role-based access (Admin/User)
- Real-time updates in admin panel
- Docker deployment setup

### Project Complexity
- Medium-low complexity
- Modern stack with well-documented technologies
- Clear separation of concerns

## Detailed Time Estimation

### 1. Environment Setup and Configuration (1-2 days)
- Repository setup (2-3 hours)
- Next.js + TypeScript configuration (2-3 hours)
- Dependencies installation and setup (2-3 hours)
- Docker configuration (3-4 hours)
* Note: Could be faster if team has existing boilerplate

### 2. Authentication System (2-3 days)
- NextAuth setup (4-6 hours)
- JWT implementation (4-6 hours)
- Role-based access control (4-6 hours)
- User management (4-6 hours)
* Additional time if SSO integration needed (+1-2 days)

### 3. Event Management System (3-4 days)
- Sanity CMS setup (4-6 hours)
- Event CRUD operations (8-10 hours)
- User permissions logic (6-8 hours)
- Image handling and validation (4-6 hours)
* Complex filtering/search features might add +1 day

### 4. Admin Panel (2-3 days)
- Dashboard UI (8-10 hours)
- Real-time updates (6-8 hours)
- Event management interface (6-8 hours)
* Additional analytics features could add +1 day

### 5. Testing & QA (2-3 days)
- Unit testing (6-8 hours)
- Integration testing (8-10 hours)
- E2E testing (8-10 hours)
- Performance testing (4-6 hours)
* Complex user flows might require +1 day

### 6. Deployment & Documentation (1-2 days)
- Docker setup finalization (4-6 hours)
- Deployment scripts (3-4 hours)
- Documentation writing (4-6 hours)
* CI/CD setup would add +1 day

## Risk Assessment & Contingency

### Low-Risk Areas (minimal buffer needed)
- Next.js setup
- UI implementation
- Basic CRUD operations

### Medium-Risk Areas (+20% buffer)
- Sanity CMS integration
- Real-time updates
- Role-based permissions

### High-Risk Areas (+30% buffer)
- Complex user flows
- Performance optimization
- Data migration (if needed)

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1 Senior Full-stack Developer (lead)
- 1 Mid-level Frontend Developer
- 1 QA Engineer (part-time)

### Infrastructure
- Sanity CMS (free tier sufficient for MVP)
- Vercel hosting (recommended)
- Redis Cloud (minimal plan)

## Timeline Summary

### Minimal Path (8-10 days)
- Basic features
- Essential testing
- Simple deployment

### Recommended Path (10-12 days)
- All core features
- Comprehensive testing
- Proper documentation
- Basic monitoring setup

### Full-Featured Path (12-15 days)
- Additional features
- Advanced analytics
- Performance optimization
- CI/CD pipeline

## Cost Implications

### Development Costs
- Team costs: ~10 developer days
- Buffer for unexpected issues: +20%

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)
- Sanity CMS: $0 (free tier)
- Vercel: $0-20
- Redis Cloud: $0-10

### Maintenance (Monthly)
- Monitoring: 2-4 hours
- Updates: 4-6 hours
- Bug fixes: 4-8 hours

## Recommendations

### MVP Approach (8-10 days)
Focus on core features:
- Basic authentication
- Event CRUD operations
- Simple admin panel

### Full Solution (12-15 days)
Additional features:
- Advanced analytics
- Real-time notifications
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing

### Future Considerations
- Email notifications system
- Payment integration
